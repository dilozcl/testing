Explanation
__init__.py File:

This file can be empty, but its presence allows Python to recognize the directory as a package.
It can also contain initialization code that you want to run when the package is imported.
Module Import:

The line from my_package import my_module in main_script.py imports the my_module.py file from the my_package directory.
This setup allows you to organize your code into packages and modules, making it easier to manage and reuse.
